\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces Period distribution of {\it Kepler}\xspace {} small planets. The observed distribution (solid line) includes planets inward of $20$ days (i.e. the 1052KOI sample), while the simulated distribution from the MCMC best fit ($\alpha = -0.04$, see Eq.2.2\hbox {}) is plotted as a dashed-dotted curve. This best fit is obtained for planets in the $20 < P < 200$ day range, but is extended here to shorter periods to demonstrate that the observed population deviates significantly from a single power-law shortward of $20$ days. The scale in the vertical axis is arbitrarily chosen. Slight horizontal offsets have been applied to each curve for clarity.\relax }}{25}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces Size distribution of planets between 1 and 4$R_{\oplus }${}, obtained using the MCMC (solid black line) and the IS (dotted red line) techniques. Both show that planet occurrence peaks in the bin $2-2.8 R_\oplus $. Earth-sized planets are less common, by a factor of $\sim 2$, although the statistical significance of this result is still low. If we assume that the currently determined planet radii carry no uncertainty, or that all stars (and hence planets) have $25\%$ larger radii than their cataloged values, we obtain rather different radius distributions. The error bars for the ``No Error'' case account for poisson error only, while for the IS and 25$\%$ Larger cases, error bars are calculated from 50 bootstrapped simulations of the data (see \S 2.3.3\hbox {}). The MCMC error bars are calculated in the standard manner. Planet occurrence at each logarithmic radius bin is obtained by summing over all period bins. Slight horizontal offsets have been applied to each curve for clarity.\relax }}{26}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces Our IS distribution displayed for a smaller logarithmic bin size. This finer resolution reveals more information about the intrinsic distribution, and specifically we see a potential rise in the number of 1-1.15$R_{\oplus }${} planets.

For these calculations, all planets have been assigned a period of 30 days. As is clearly seen, the completeness variation is much larger among the Earths vs. Neptunes, illustrating how one can introduce significant detection bias into the occurrence calculations of small planets if an average over all stars is not taken.\relax }}{30}
