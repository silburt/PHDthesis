%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

\begin{abstract}
  
Since the launch of the \textit{Kepler Space Telescope}, scientists have, for the first time ever, had an opportunity to study planetary systems outside our own and test longstanding theories about planetary dynamics.
Thousands of exoplanets have been detected by a variety of methods, and universal properties of exoplanetary systems are beginning to emerge. 

In the first part of this thesis a statistical reconstruction of the radius and period distributions of \kep planets is performed. 
Accounting for observation and detection biases, as well as measurement errors, we calculate the occurrence of planetary systems, including the prevalence of Earth-like planets.
This calculation is compared to other works in the field, and we find the broad details consistent with differing specifics.
 
The second component of this thesis deals with the formation of exoplanetary systems.
First, \kep systems near 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) are analyzed to determine whether tides alone can transport them from exact MMR to their observed locations.
Second, a new hybrid integrator \hermes is presented, which is capable of simulating N-bodies undergoing close encounters, with the original intent of simulating the formation of planetary systems embedded in planetesimal disks. 
Third, formation scenarios for 
 
Longterm stability is a 
 
The statistics, formation and stability of HD155358 is investigated. 
New orbital parameters are derived from previously observed radial velocity data using a Bayesian framework, constraints are placed on the viable parameters able to explain its formation, and a longterm stability analysis is conducted.
