%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

\begin{abstract}
  
It is only in the past two decades that scientists have had an opportunity to study planetary systems outside the Solar System and test planetary theories against observations.
More recently, the past decade has yielded thousands of exoplanet detections through a variety of methods, and collective properties of exoplanetary systems are now emerging. 
This thesis contributes to the exoplanet field by analyzing the statistics, formation and stability of exoplanetary systems.

The first part of this thesis conducts a statistical reconstruction of the radius and period distributions of \kep planets. 
Accounting for observation and detection biases, as well as measurement errors, we calculate the occurrence of planetary systems, including the prevalence of Earth-like planets.
This calculation is compared to related works, finding both similarities and differences. 
 
The second part of this thesis investigates the formation of \kep planets near mean motion resonance (MMR).
In particular, 27 \kep systems near 2:1 MMR are analyzed to determine whether tides are a viable mechanism for transporting \kep planets from mean motion resonance.
We find that tides alone cannot transport near-resonant planets from exact 2:1 MMR to their observed locations, and other mechanisms must be invoked to explain their formation.

Third, a new hybrid integrator \hermes is presented, which is capable of simulating N-bodies undergoing close encounters.
\hermes is specifically designed for planets embedded in planetesimal disks, and includes an adaptive routine for optimizing the close encounter boundary to help maintain accuracy whilst close encounters are occurring.
The performance of \hermes is compared to other popular integrators, and we find \hermes to be a great balance of speed and accuracy.
 
Fourth, the longterm stability of planetary systems is investigated using machine learning techniques.
Typical studies of longterm stability require thousands of realizations to acquire statistically rigorous results, which can take weeks or months to perform. 
Here we find that a trained machine is capable of accurately classifying longterm planet stability, and is orders of magnitude faster than direct N-body integration. 
 
Finally, the planetary system HD155358, consisting of two Jovian-sized planets near 2:1 MMR, is investigated using previously collected radial velocity data. 
New orbital parameters are derived using a Bayesian framework, and from this we find a high likelihood that the planets are in MMR.
In addition, constraints are placed on the formation history of HD155358, and our best-fit parameters land firmly in dynamically stable regions of parameter space.

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
