%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

%% ***   Add any desired options.   ***

%% The line spacing of the document should be specified using one of
%% the document options given above, but if you need a line spacing
%% that is not provided by the options, you can override the default
%% line spacing for the entire document with the command
%%   `\linespacing{...}'.
%% Note that in order to get the correct appearance, the argument to
%% `\linespacing' must be equal to 1/3 + 2/3 times the desired line
%% spacing (for example, single-spaced = \linespacing{1},
%%                        1 1/2-spaced = \linespacing{1.33}, and
%%                       double-spaced = \linespacing{1.66}).

\begin{document}


%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% You should put all of your `\newcommand', `\newenvironment', and
%% `\newtheorem's (in other words, all the global definitions that
%% you will need throughout your thesis) in a separate file and use
%% "\input{filename}" to input it here.

\input{thesiscommands}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
  
  MY ABSTRACT GOES HERE.
  
\end{abstract}
\cleardoublepage
%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage
%% and the table of contents starts with \clearpage.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%%\begin{dedication}
%%My Dedication
%%\end{dedication}

%\newpage
%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
\begin{acknowledgements}

My Acknowledgements go here.

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page.     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% ***   Include chapter files here.   ***

\include{intro/intro}
\include{chap2/chap2}
\include{chap3/chap3}
\include{chap4/chap4}
\include{chap5/chap5}
\include{conc/conc}

%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}

%% ***   Set the bibliography style.   ***
%% (change according to your preference)
\bibliographystyle{apj}
%% ***   Set the bibliography file.   ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change if needed)
\bibliography{thesis}

%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file
%% and `\include' or `\input' it here).
