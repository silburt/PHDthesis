\section{Conclusions}

Over the course of this thesis, we have sought to identify and
characterize the Milky Way's most luminous star clusters. Initially,
we identify them through their environmental signatures of gas
morphology and reprocessed emission. Subsequently, we seek to identify
their massive stellar populations directly. It is through this process
that we substantially increase the number of young, massive star
clusters known in the Galaxy and better characterize the upper end of
the Galactic cluster mass function. 

In Chapter \ref{chap:sfcs}, we use data from Spitzer GLIMPSE and radio
recombination line surveys to identify SFCs within the 13 most
luminous WMAP free-free emission sources in the Galaxy. On the basis
of morphology from the 8 \micron\, emission and radial velocities from
radio recombination lines, we identify 40 SFCs, some of which are
expected to contain young clusters or OB associations with masses
greater than $10^4$ M$_{\sun}$. Based on the locations of the SFCs, we
estimate that the scale height of Galactic O-type stars to be $35\pm5$
pc, consistent with previous values. With the free-free emission
measurements from WMAP and the 8 \micron\, emission measurements from
Spitzer GLIMPSE, we find a nearly linear relationship between the two
integrated over the area of the WMAP sources. Having estimated the
expansion velocity of the bubbles associated with the SFCs, we show
that the mechanical luminosity from the expansion of bubbles
accounting for one-third of the Galaxy's star formation can account
for approximately one-third of the luminosity require to maintain the
velocity dispersion of the molecular gas inside the solar circle,
suggesting that the expansion of bubbles surrounding the most luminous
star clusters and OB associations is likely sufficient to support the
observed turbulence of the molecular gas disk. Further, we show that
the kinetic energy of some of the largest bubbles in the sample is
similar to those of previously known superbubbles, likely prior to a
single supernova taking place, indicating that some of these bubbles
are progenitors of the superbubbles. Finally, based on statistical
arguments of projection, we show that the observed shell structure in
the 8 \micron\, morphology is more consistent with the hypothesis of
limb brightened shells rather than flattened rings.

In Chapter \ref{chap:dfcand}, we search for the powering stellar
population of the most luminous SFC identified in Chapter
\ref{chap:sfcs}, the Dragonfish Nebula. We use the 2MASS point source
catalog to identify candidate O-type stars consistent with the
distance and extinction of the Dragonfish Nebula, using colour cuts
around the expected extinction to filter out most line-of-sight
contaminating stars. Based on the size and demographics of the
overdensity, we classify it as a candidate OB association. We find a
significant overdensity of point sources with extinction between $0.96
< A_K < 1.2$ towards the centre of the SFC. Subtracting the
contribution of field sources, we find $406 \pm 102$ sources in the
candidate association appearing as O- and early B-type stars at the
distance of the association, consistent with the expected population
based on its total ionizing luminosity. Based on the ionizing
luminosity and point source demographics, we find that the candidate
OB association is likely the most luminous OB association known in the
Galaxy.

In Chapter \ref{chap:dfspec}, we seek to confirm the existence of the
Dragonfish Association, identified in Chapter \ref{chap:dfcand}. We
take NIR spectroscopy of a sample of possible O-stars in the candidate
Dragonfish Association in the $H$- and $K$-bands using the SOFI
spectrograph on the NTT 3.6m telescope in La Silla, Chile. With the
identification of Brackett-series hydrogen and helium absorption
lines, we find that 15 of the 50 stars identified are O-type stars. In
addition, we identify a late-type WN star through hydrogen line
emission, and two LBV candidates using helium and forbidden iron line
emission. Based on the population statistics, we confirm the existence
of the Dragonfish association and its estimated ionizing luminosity
and stellar mass, inferring the existence of a low-mass association
population from the stellar initial mass function. In addition to the
confirmation of the association, the spectroscopy validates the method
developed in Chapter \ref{chap:dfcand} and adds evidence to the
candidate associations/clusters identified through it.

In Chapter \ref{chap:candclust}, we refine the method of Chapter
\ref{chap:dfcand} to apply to the remaining SFCs from Chapter
\ref{chap:sfcs}. Including the Dragonfish association from Chapter
\ref{chap:dfcand}, we find that 22 of the 40 SFCs host candidate
clusters, either central to the SFC or on its periphery. We constrain
the false positive rate of the candidates to be $3.0 \pm 0.6$, and we
find that the candidates have a strong correlation between their
measured extinction and the modeled extinction based on the distance
of their host SFC. These two lines of evidence, added with the
confirmation of the Dragonfish Association from Chapter
\ref{chap:dfspec}, indicate the reality of the candidates
identified. We estimate the masses and luminosity of the candidates,
showing that the candidates can account for the observed WMAP
free-free flux for most of the investigated sources. We, finally,
produce the census of the Galactic OB associations and clusters with
ages $< 4$ Myrs and masses $> 10^{4}$ M$_{\sun}$, showing that with
this work, we have doubled the number of such known clusters. Based on
extragalactic estimates, we estimate that the census is now within a
factor of two to completion and we indicate the locations on the
Galactic plane that may likely host the remaining young, massive OB
associations and stellar clusters.

To summarize, in this thesis we have found some of the most luminous
(and massive) young OB associations and clusters in the Galaxy.

\section{Future Work and Directions}

With the identification and characterization of a large new sample of
young, massive clusters and OB associations from this thesis, there is
a plethora of different avenues of future work and investigation. We
summarize a number of these directions and classify them into two
overarching categories: characterizing the stellar populations
themselves and characterizing their energetic feedback into the
Galactic disk and halo.

\subsection{Characterization of Stellar Populations}
\label{subsect:charstel}
While the locations for a large number of new massive clusters and OB
associations have been determined in this thesis, very little has been
determined about their stellar population. Even their very reality
requires independent confirmation with additional evidence beyond
statistical stellar density arguments. We outline a number of
alternative means to confirm the existence of the clusters and
determine the composition and distribution of the stellar members.

\subsubsection{Spectroscopic Follow-up}

As was conducted in Chapter \ref{chap:dfspec} for the Dragonfish
Association, follow-up spectroscopy on individual candidate cluster
members will enable precise spectroscopic typing of the stars. Since
these clusters are located at large ($> 2$ kpc) distances within the
Galactic disk, extinction becomes a substantial problem; while the
spectroscopic typing of massive stars is best conducted in the optical
bands, this is likely only possible for the nearest
clusters/associations with relatively low extinction. For the most
deeply-veiled clusters/associations, the line-of-sight extinction may
only permit spectroscopy in the NIR bands, where the spectra of an
O-type star is nearly featureless \citep{gray09}. To further
complicate matters, the spectral features due to interstellar
absorption are similar to the depth of the features intrinsic to the
spectra (Chapter \ref{chap:dfspec}).

While the advent of NIR multi-object spectrographs will enable greater
numbers of stars to be tested at a time, direct spectroscopy of stars
is inherently a low yield technique for highly confused
clusters/associations.  In many of the cases from Chapter
\ref{chap:candclust}, the ratio of cluster stars to confusing sources
along the line of sight is worse than 1:1 after the colour-selection
criteria are applied. Additionally, many of these candidates have
$\sim 10^3$ OB stars identified in 2MASS, requiring substantial effort
and telescope time to fully classify every identified cluster
candidate. 

However, despite these challenges, direct spectroscopic follow-up of
candidate cluster stars provides a simple, robust determination of the
reality of the candidate cluster/OB association. Spectroscopic
observations also allow the identification of the exotic, evolved
massive star phases, such as the Wolf-Rayet and luminous blue variable
phases (Chapter \ref{chap:dfspec}). The identification of these short
lived states and their population statistics may in the future lead to
robust estimates of the age of the cluster or association. 

\subsubsection{Point Source X-ray Observations}

Over the past decade, the {\em Chandra X-ray Observatory} has been
beneficial for the characterization of young, massive stellar clusters
and OB associations \citep{moffat02, wang08}. Recently, the detailed
work of \citet{townsley11} for the Carina region has highlighted the
advantages of using the X-ray regime to characterize massive stellar
populations through X-ray emitting OB stars and colliding-wind
binaries. The relatively large ($\sim 1/3$\degr) field-of-view permits
even some of the widest OB associations to be observed at once. In the
case of the Carina region, this has lead to the discovery of a large,
diffuse population of OB stars outside the dense clusters
\citep{povich11}.

In addition to the X-ray emitting OB stars, the high energy regime
enables the detection of the flaring intermediate-mass pre-main
sequence stellar population \citep{povich11b}. The detection of this
population is unique to the X-ray regime as these sources would be too
faint to observe in the optical or infrared wavelengths. 

However, the challenge of X-ray observations include the extremely
long exposure times required to obtain sufficient sensitivity to the
X-ray emitting sources in the clusters with large distances and
extinguishing columns ($\sim 10^2$ ks). Further, there is a limited
number of facilities capable of making such observations ($\sim 1$).

\subsubsection{Astrometric Observations}

Precision (near microarcsecond) astrometry enabled through space-based
facilities such as the {\em Hubble Space Telescope} and ground-based
multi-conjugate adaptive optics is allowing the separation of cluster
and contaminating sources on the basis of relative proper
motions. This process has been successfully conducted on NGC 3603
\citep{rochau10}. This technique provides an entirely unbiased
sampling of all objects in the field, enabling the identification of
cluster members that would be otherwise excluded by colour cuts or
chance X-ray emission processes. However, the large distances to the
clusters/associations require multi-year epochs of observation to
provide sufficient proper motion sensitivity to separate cluster and
contaminant sources.

\subsection{Characterization of Feedback }

Studying the energetic feedback processes of young, massive clusters
and associations into their environment requires knowledge of both the
powering stellar population and its energetic output. We have
discussed avenues to characterize the stellar populations above. The
energetic output can be measured through reprocessed emission,
possibly coming from the winds or ionizing photons produced, or the
kinematics and morphology of the region being acted upon. This new
population of young, massive clusters and associations is well suited
for studies of energetic feedback; the complexes were initially
identified through their reprocessed emission and morphology, meaning
that their large scale structure beyond the position of individual
stars is established. We outline possible directions for feedback
studies using these associations.

\subsubsection{Molecular Mapping}

Mapping the SFCs and their surrounding natal clouds with a molecular
tracer, such as $^{12}$CO, will enable studies of the feedback of
these clusters/associations into their natal GMCs. We are in the midst
of conducting such a study of the Dragonfish Nebula currently, using
data obtained with the Mopra Observatory in Australia. While CO
surveys of the Galactic Plane do exist \citep{dame01}, they tend to
have relatively low ($\sim 1/8$\degr) angular resolution, insufficient
to resolve the structure caused by feedback effects. Sub-arcminute,
wide field ($\ga 1$\degr) CO surveys surrounding the SFCs will enable
investigations into the driving of large scale structure into the GMC,
the cascading of turbulence in the molecular gas, and the kinematics
of GMC destruction. These observations will help connect the evolution
of young, massive clusters to the life cycle of a GMC in a detailed
manner.

\subsubsection{Diffuse Emission X-ray Observations}

Beyond characterizing stellar populations (as noted in
\S\ref{subsect:charstel}), X-ray observations are uniquely capable of
measuring the hot gas originating from stellar winds
\citep{townsley11b}. The diffuse X-ray emission can be extracted using
long ($> 60$ ks) exposures, binned over arcminute-sized zones,
removing the coincident X-ray point sources. Measuring the diffuse hot
gas through X-rays enables a direct measure of the cluster's wind
feedback and energetics. From these measurements, we can determine the
total pressure contributed by the hot winds into the bubble inflated
by the central cluster. This will enable the direct determination of
the driving of energetic feedback into the ambient medium.
